    "In a controlled trial of male and female patients with acne, a minimum of 3 months\u2019 treatment with Agnus castus resulted in an improvement for 70% of patients, which was significantly better than placebo. Patients were treated with Agnus castus (equivalent to 36mg/day of dried fruit) for 4 to 6 weeks, followed by a lower dose for 1 to 2 years. The mechanism for the beneficial treatment on acne is not known but may be a result of a mild antiandrogenic effect. (KB)"
